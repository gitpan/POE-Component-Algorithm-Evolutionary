=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary - Run evolutionary algorithms in a preemptive multitasking way.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary version 0.0.3


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary;

  use Algorithm::Evolutionary qw( Individual::BitString Op::Creator 
				  Op::CanonicalGA Op::Bitflip 
				  Op::Crossover Op::GenerationalTerm
				  Fitness::Royal_Road);

  my $bits = shift || 64;
  my $block_size = shift || 4;
  my $pop_size = shift || 256; #Population size
  my $numGens = shift || 200; #Max number of generations
  my $selection_rate = shift || 0.2;

  #Initial population
  my $creator = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Creator( $pop_size, 'BitString', { length => $bits });

  # Variation operators
  my $m = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Bitflip->new( 1 );
  my $c = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::Crossover->new(2, 4);

  # Fitness function: create it and evaluate
  my $rr = new  Algorithm::Evolutionary::Fitness::Royal_Road( $block_size );

  my $generation = Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::CanonicalGA->new( $rr , $selection_rate , [$m, $c] ) ;
  my $gterm = new Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::GenerationalTerm 10;

  POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary->new( Fitness => $rr,
						Creator => $creator,
						Single_Step => $generation,
						Terminator => $gterm,
						Alias => 'Canonical' );


  $poe_kernel->run();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Not a lot here: it creates a component that uses POE to run an
evolutionary algorithm 

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 AUTOLOAD

Automatically defines accesors for instance variables. For instance,
    $session->Fitness() would return the fitness object, of
    $self->Population() return the population hashref.

=cut

=head2 new

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary->new( Fitness => $rr,
					      Creator => $creator,
					      Single_Step => $generation,
					      Terminator => $gterm,
					      Alias => 'Canonical',
                                              After_Step => $after_step_code);

It's called with all components needed to run an evolutionary
algorithm; to keep everything flexible they are created in
advance. See the C<scripts/> directory for an example.

=head2 new_population

Called with a hashref to the new population to incorporate

=head2 start

Called internally for initializing population

=head2 generation

This is run once for each generation, until end condition is met

=head2 after_step

Run always after each generation, with hooks so that you can add your
    own code. The first argument for the subroutine will be a
    population hash, and the second the argument that the event
    receives. 


=head2 finishing

Called when everything is over. Prints winner

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

POE::Component::Algorithm::Evolutionary requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Main dependence is L<Algorithm::Evolutionary>; however, it's not
included by default, since you must pick and choose the modules you
are going to actually use.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
