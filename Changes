	* 0.2.1: fixed bad pod docs in POEtic, added more generations to
	test to avoid problems with not improving average. 

2009-02-12  Juan J. Merelo  <jmerelo@vega>

	* Makefile.PL: Added an 'after_step' event to make easier do stuff
	after each generation, changed Makefile and changed to 0.1 since
	it looks like it already does something useful. 

2009-02-10  jmerelo  <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* 0.0.4.1 lib/POE/Component/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm (new): Forgot to include POE in the dependencies.

2009-02-09  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* lib/POE/Component/Algorithm/Evolutionary.pm: Changing to 0.0.4
	for minor doc changes
